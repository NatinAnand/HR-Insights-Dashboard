# HR-Insights-Dashboard
The HR Insights Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze key HR metrics and uncover actionable insights for better workforce management. The dashboard explores general demographics (average age: 41.69 years, attrition: 2, average salary: $79.11K, and performance rating: 3.19), attrition trends (higher in IT and HR, with female employees showing increased rates), and salary analysis (Finance leads in salaries, with gender disparities across departments). It also highlights training allocations, engagement scores (6/12), absences (8 days), and overtime hours (11 hours). Performance ratings were highest for Managers and Analysts, while Consultants and Developers lagged behind.
